# LiDAR-DTM-DSM-Hydrology
This repository emphasizes the integration of LiDAR point cloud processing, DTM/DSM extraction, hydrology mapping, and 3D visualization using modern Python tools.


🚀 LiDAR data processing and visualization!



Using Whitebox Workflows in Python, I was able to bring together multiple geospatial products all in one place:



 ✅ Point Cloud Mapping

 ✅ DTM & DSM Extraction

 ✅ River Network & Contours Generation

 ✅ 3D Visualization for better terrain understanding



This workflow highlights how powerful LiDAR is in deriving detailed surface and terrain models, and how Python makes it possible to automate and visualize complex geospatial processes efficiently. 🌍✨
